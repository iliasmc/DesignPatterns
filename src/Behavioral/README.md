## Behavioral Design Patterns

Behavioral patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects. They describe 
how objects communicate by characterising complex control flow.

>Behavioral ***class*** patterns use *inheritance* to distribute behavior between objects.

>Behavioral ***object*** patterns use *object composition* to describe how a group of objects
> cooperate to perform a task that no single object can perform. The end goal is peers know as little as possible
> about each other to reduce coupling.

The most common structural patterns are:

- Interpreter (class)
- Template Method (class)
- Chain of responsibility (object)
- State (object)
- Mediator (object)
- Strategy (object)
- Command (object)
- Memento (object)
- Observer (object)
- Visitor (object)
- Iterator (object)

More detailed descriptions of each of them are given in the READMEs of the patterns.
