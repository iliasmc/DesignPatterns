## Creational Design Patterns

Creational patterns abstract the instantiation process. They help make a system independent of how its objects are 
created, composed, and represented.

>Creational ***class*** patterns defer some part of object creation to subclasses.

>Creational ***object*** patterns delegate instantiation to another object.

The most common creational patterns are:

- Factory Method (class)
- Abstract Factory (object)
- Builder (object)
- Singleton (object)
- Prototype (object)

More detailed descriptions of each of them are given in the READMEs of the patterns.
