## Description

>Ensure a class only has one instance, and provide a global point of access to it.

## When to use

- There should be only one instance of a class, and it must be accessible to clients from a well-known access point.
- When the sole instance should be extensible by subclassing, and clients should be able to use an extended instance
without modifying their code.

## Example

1. *Singleton* -> CurrencyConverter
