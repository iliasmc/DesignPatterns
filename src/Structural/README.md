## Structural Design Patterns

Structural patterns are concerned with how classes and objects are composed to form larger structures.

>Structural ***class*** patterns use *inheritance* to compose interfaces or implementations. 

>Structural ***object*** patterns describe ways to compose objects to realize new functionality. 
>They use object composition which allows flexibility in changing at runtime and reduced static dependencies.

The most common structural patterns are:

- Adapter (class and object)
- Bridge (object)
- Composite (object)
- Decorator (object)
- Proxy (object)
- Facade (object)
- Flyweight (object)

More detailed descriptions of each of them are given in the READMEs of the patterns.
