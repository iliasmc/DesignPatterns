## What is a design pattern?

A design pattern names, abstracts, and identifies the key aspects of a common design structure that make it useful for 
creating object-oriented design. It is a high level solution to recurring design problems that arise in OOP systems. 
They are not one-size-fits-all, every design problem requires a slightly different variation of different patterns.

## Why are design patterns so useful?
Design patterns are formed from the best practices for OOP programming, and using them in the right scenario will:
 
 - Make your code more testable
 - Decouple the architecture of your system
 - Allow for easy expansion or change
 
 Learning them, getting experience in applying them in the right circumstances will help you make systems composed of 
 a better architecture. Using them right will allow you to comform to the SOLID principles.

## What are design patterns composed of?
The common characteristics of a lot of patterns are:
 
 - Relying on abstractions rather than implementations
 - Preferring object delegation over inheritance
 - Decoupling as much as possible

## Which are the most common patterns?

The most common patterns are have one of three **purposes**

1. ***Creational*** take care of object creation.
2. ***Structural*** compose classes and objects into larger structures.
3. ***Behavioral*** are concerned with the assignment of responsibilities between objects.

Each of them have two **scopes**:

1. ***Class*** scope patterns rely on inheritance
2. ***Object*** scope patterns rely on object delegation
